I don't know. Sitting here now answering this question on Reddit, I'd turn her down. I'm not interested in casual sex. But if this actually happened, I don't know that I could refuse. I'd like to think I'd be strong enough to. My lizard brain might take over.

I mean, I'm not particularly invested here. If you came out with some navy seal copypasta sounding story I likely wouldn't believe you. It's more that I find a lot of people take for granted their ability to handle panic situations well. I've been in a bunch of them. Sometimes I handled it really well, and a few times I broke and just lost my shit. Once I just shut down and walked away in a fugue. Its a hell of a thing man, and I don't know that I could count on it in that context.

They complain when black people riot, and tell them to find some other way to protest peacefully. They complain when black people block roads, and tell to find some other way to protest peacefully. When they find a way to protest peacefully, they still find a way to have a problem with it. it just leads me to believe that they want black people to just know their place and shut up, or protest in a way that isn't visible.

A bit, but drugs aren't superstitious nonsense. They're a real consumer product, and an addictive one at that. Drugs are always going to be around. The demand for rhino horns is literally just religious/cultural superstition. It revolves around a singular belief that's just total bullshit. Drugs work, and are addictive. They're not culturally relative. They're used globally, and they'll always be around. Therefore the blame for what goes on is different.

I don't think you can argue this very well, because someone who has less morals or ethics than another person is not excluded from acting morally or ethicallt, but someone who does have morals and ethics would not act immoral or unethical. For this reason the person who has less morals or ethics has a larger set of options when making money compared to the more moral/ethical, so they will always make equal or better than the moral person. I think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally.

Actually we can make water. Pretty easily. Ignoring the extremely simple desalinzation plants many places use, because that's just easy. We can just combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce power and water. There are even places that do this combined with solar panels for power all day and night.

I don't see how illegalizing internships does anything. Wealthy people will be able to easily find an alternative and gain the same experience that costs even more than an internship does, excluding more people. Really, how is internship any different from college? You increase future earning potential for a price. The only reason poor people even go to college is with student loans.

The left doesn't outright deliver a list of banned words, you're right. I would argue that the left is primarily responsible determining what words are appropriate or inappropriate to say in society. For example, I have seen the left heavily attack people that use whatever language is deemed to be inappropriate, or even further, they heavily attack people that don't use the language deemed to be correct. Transgender pronouns are the best example I can think of regarding this.

All we know is that Al called in sick to sick to avoid the summit but then was at a beach house. Was he actually sick? We don't know. We also don't know what took place during the phone call... maybe Al blew up and lost his temper prompting the officials to pull him. Maybe he was completely reasonable and this is a dick move by the UFC. point being, we don't know, so stay skeptic and don't pick sides on this issue until all the cards are shown

I'm trying to make a nuanced point here.. not sure if I can dumb it down any more. I'm trying to say, when you call them supporters, it implies they are supporting him out of normal political reasons, and that if he fails to live up to his promises they will abandon him. I am arguing that we stop calling them ""supporters"" because that normalizes fanaticism and personality cults. And no, Red Guards were not merely ""Mao supporters"" unless you are disingenuously applying the very broadest use of the word.

How is this ""association"" relevant to ending racism? You still haven't explained how accepting culture appropriation would help end racism. You're just saying it would without explaining how. Just because it's common for many people of the same race to share many aspects of the same culture doesn't mean anything. It really doesn't mean there is a link. Race doesn't determine your culture and culture doesn't determine your race. I don't think you understand what racism is.

Not American, but I find these posts weird... I feel that the priority issue now is D. Trump. Biden can potentially draw out Trump supporters and Democrats will vote for him either way, because who else? Trump? If Biden wins, USA will have a more left-leaning candidate than Trump and IMO it will be a lot easier to push a green new deal or other left-wing politics.

They may not have been exposed to it enough to catch when they were younger. It's not a built in time bomb, it's a disease you have to be exposed to. And some people don't develope full immunities from vaccines. Or the immunity wears off sooner than ideal. Which is why you caught chicken pox after being vaccinated and why I have to take the MMR vaccine. Immunities aren't binary, it's not that you are immune or you're not. Immunities are a spectrum.

If we’re talking about women the absolutely. Unpopular opinion but I think female sex workers are the only honest women. They’re straightforward about the fact that their only use for men is money, and they know that men want sex. They cut out all the bullshit and get to the point. I wish all women were that honest.

Our founding fathers feared political parties and even talked about the scourge they’d become when some of them wrote the federalist papers. The problem with these two parties is that they’re so hard to fix, if your party fractures you lose power for potentially decades. On the positive side it makes our government at the federal level very slow moving. It lets all of our states run themselves, for better or worse.

I think because everything is mostly fine in the game, there's a vacuum. The negative folks need to find reasons to be negative. The white knights need to white knight about shit for no reason. People post silly questions on the DHT because they want to talk about something. It's why I truly like this sub more. Nobody over here seems all that concerned.

Yeah it sucks. It doesn't help that Israel's government is increasingly hostile towards the strip. It validates the terrorists and rallies the civilians behind them in some instances.

I'm fine with it as well. Actually where I'm from in Siberia, I get the feeling there's a mix of Asian and Western culture. Because when I was growing up slurping was OK, but chewing with your mouth open was not. Then I lived in the States and Europe, and there slurping was definitely frowned upon as well. I say if the soup or coffee/tea is hot, slurping is better than burning your tongue, so fuck what people think. Chewing with your mouth open and smacking your lips is just unnecessary.

Im not sure in a series. I am sure for a year/entire playoff. The snek is too fucking good. The skyfucker too efficient to discount. The brow and giannis are untested but extremely dominant. KD can guard LeBron better than *anybody* can guard KD as far as I'm concerned. Granted, we haven't seen KD carry a team, this game is still about buckets and 3 points aren't always just 3 points. I'm sure a snek will explain later.

We aren't debating psychological states. We are debating truth claims. According to that definition of atheism my left foot is an atheist and my dog is an atheist. That definition is true regardless of whether God exists because it is a psychological state so with that definition both atheism and theism are true... It is utterly useless.

Absolutely. But ""socialization"" is not a monolith. ""Women are discouraged from lucrative careers"" and ""men are willing to sacrifice more for their careers because they are judged more harshly on them"" both goes under socialization, but they're extremely different explanations. I don't think there's anyone outside a small minority that argues that socialization plays no role at all.

It's the Catholics. The official position is that God should determine when you're going to have children, not you. They also say that the rhythm method is okay and that it's wrong to try to get gay men to use condoms. It makes me think they're okay with the ineffective rhythm method in order to trick married straight couples into conceiving and that they're using the fear of STIs to try to get the rest of us to stop having sex.

This is true, in part, but it also seems like the GOP has effectively jumped the gun on their end-game of a society of brainwashed serfs, and are going to burn themselves out within a decade. The cult of Trump is only losing members, while the viewership of Fox News continues to die off and progressives continue to rally behind principles and the principled people who embody them. The long game is looking good, we just need to stay alert and active, so we survive the short-term clusterfuckery.

No, but the alternative is to allow the woman to not work and then if the marriage ends, she has nothing. So if alimony laws change, I suspect VERY few women would ever agree to get married and stay home to raise the kids. That would do more to change the nature of marriage and families in America than probably anything else I can think of.

yeah prison rape definitley feels like something that's way more talked about in American culture/media as being a thing in prison. I'm sure many Americans won't believe me but it really isn't anywhere as much as a thing in British prisons as it is in American prisons, based on accounts from people who've been to prison in America and people who've been in British ones

What ideas specifically? No one is being prevented from entering the country based on religion. Go look at homeland security's snapshot on terrorism from last year and you'll get to see the exact justification for these 7 countries including Iran which everyone seems so confused by. Also, it is a 4 month waiting period to determine future policy. Finally, You're throwing religion in to ID politics while railing against it.

I’ve never been much of a flower giver, but my ex woke something up in me and I loved getting her flowers. I went to an informal flower design session so I could learn how to pick out flowers and cut them appropriately to the narrow vase I had given her. I would only spend $8-12 at a time, and it was the greatest thing in the world seeing how happy she got receiving flowers just because it was Tuesday.

Nah, that's Hamas' success because it was part of their plan: They were fully expecting civilian deaths when they purposely hid weapons in schools/hospitals and launching rockets from heavily populated areas. IDF actually ""knocked"" on the buildings before sending in the real bombs, but Hamas didn't give a single fuck about their own people and used them as shields.

Because in this case a persons beliefs can actually lead to harm to a child. Think of it like this, if a persons religious beliefs involved throwing a knife at someone, would this be allowed? It is there religious belief and the knife may or may not actually harm the person. But it still wouldn't be allowed. In this case not vaccinating the kid could potentially harm them, even kill them and therefore the duty to vaccinate should supersede religious beliefs. I'm not sure what you're trying to say in the second part of your comment, please clarify that.

First of all, there is no way that a President should be criticizing any journalist by name. That’s patently unconstitutional. Second, criticism from Trump about anybody is literally a target on their back, because his base are such lunatics that they will dox, threaten, and attack people on Trump’s word. The only thing gross about this is how long it took someone on Fox News to realize what was happening to journalists.

Wow people..... They never said the ban was imposed due to religion. Everyone bringing up the islamic religion is providing their own information to the fight. Legally I can walk around completely covered up head to toe and wear a mask on top of that and eventually I guarantee somebody would complain and ask me to stop because it made them feel unsafe or whatever. It's human nature to feel threatened by someone who decides to cover their face. I'm not saying I agree with the ban but the comments are ridiculous and completely missing the point.

In the case of education, its not so much capitalism, but a shitty system where it's considered okay to accrue significant amounts of debt without looking at the value proposition education offers, since loans are so easy to come by. There are two easy solutions: 1. Fully fund *everyone's* post-secondary education, so that governments can use their collective bargaining power to keep prices reasonable. 2. *Completely* eliminate loans and government bursaries for post-secondary education. Force schools to compete on cost again. This is a very capitalist solution.

There are relatively simple ways around all of the provisions you're talking about. It doesn't matter what security you put in place, it can be bypassed relatively simply, especially by terrorist organizations dedicated solely to doing things just like that. Respond to the meat of my post. How is this airline not painting a bright red bullseye on their planes? And more importantly, how would anyone feel safer taking these flights knowing that there is no airline muslim terrorists are more dedicated to terrorizing than the one you're flying with?

I guess it depends on where you are when attacked. If you are attacked in a building you might have huge advantages (locking doors, getting weapons,etc) or somewhere you can climb vertically (just keep kicking it as it tries to climb up or throw items down).

I don't believe why there's still US politicians that want a war with Iran. I mean for fuck sake, it's not a small country with a small military. Attacking Iran directly the same way the US did with Iraq would be absolutely horrible for them. It's Iraq and Afghanistan on steroids.

The redesign makes reddit easier to use for luddites, therefore increasing appeal for existing social media users who may have previously found reddit “too retro” to navigate and understand. This redesign serves only to increase the user base of reddit, and therefore increase profit generated. It is as simple as that, you guys are overthinking it.

You said you're capable and willing to defend these arguments so I'll start with two simple questions: What reason is there to believe objective moral values exist? I've never had a theist answer this question with anything but an appeal to emotion or popularity, or to ridicule moral relativism in place of it. How can one possibly take a resurrection event as anything but near-zero probability in their Bayesian analysis without first already arguing that a god exists (therefore miracles can happen) and thus how are you not making a circular argument?

There is a shit tone of professional research on the issues surrounding masculinity and masculine ideals. There are a bunch of books available on the subject too. It is not mainstream because men have no movement equivalent to feminism and some feminist writers see being male as a solely positive experience. If you want to learn about that stuff a book to start with is Masculinities by R. W. Connell. They are considered the top authority on masculinity in the world. If you want me to share more info reply and I'll grab more book names and authors.

Woody Allen. The dude groomed his wife's daughter from the age after 13, waited till she was 18, then fucked her. Grooming is the key here, a brother whom is several years older than little sister, lightly exposes her to ideas, then the trust that is built up through the years gets abused. Same with daddy and daughter. Imbalance of power and a situation that gets built from childhood. It is just all kinds of fucked up.

Bad idea. Women are bad at making decisions and then sticking to that decision. Threesomes should only be done as a way of breaking up because that's what's likely to happen. And don't givee that shit about the guy not being allowed to look at or touch the other woman. If your wife gets to have another sexual partner then so do you.

Really it’s not that big an issue, but if there happens to be a line, men can use the restroom much faster than women, and it’s kinda an inconvenience to wait 2-3 minutes per person for 20 seconds of bathroom time.

One of these days I plan on writing a book called ""Women are from Earth, and Men are too."" Which would highlight all the forced differences we've placed in interactions between people when it comes to gender and sex which has caused us to dehumanize each other. I feel it is related to this because I think humanity's natural belief/state is one of feminism but humanity has lied to itself about what feminism is and its goals to create unnecessary conflict.

You are being naive if you think that you can realistically ban cities from paying sports teams. You will just change it to cities bribing the teams with infrastructure, zoning changes, and possibly good old fashioned corruption instead. There is also another downside that you are forgetting: the city wants the stadium to be in the middle of the city because it have positive knock on effect to the city. The owner wants it to be where the land is cheap in the outskirts.

“MMR vaccine does not cause autism, another study confirms” What they desperately need is a treatment that foreshortens memory retention in the masses.

I hope you are right, but I don't see any evidence of that. Just look at what happened to the Our Revolution organization. The problem Progressives have, as i see it, is a common one: lack of a centralized organization. There are too many splinter groups. The same thing applies to the Anti-Citizens United groups. Bernie was not only someone that energized people, but he was a figure that folks from many different movements rallied around.

It might not be, but if they want the court to acknowledge they have legitimate reasons to want to forcibly extract money from someone, then they bloody well should have to demonstrate it. Forcible extraction of money from someone is literally theft. To have the courts mandate it, you have to demonstrate to the public that it is warranted, or the public looses faith in its institutions. I am not really fond of guilty unless proven otherwise

It's not against Gods will to have sex with your married partner whenever you want. It's against God's will to try to prevent a possible fertilization when you do have sex, whether through birth control, barrier methods, pulling out, or whatever. Having sex when you're naturally infertile or barely fertile due to your hormonal cycle without protection doesn't lessen the natural chance of fertilization, and thus, is fine.

Unfortunately, yes. Although it has heightened definitely since then. There are people who regard her father as a great person, since he was the only dictator that used his absolute power for ""good"" (for certain people). People who lived during his rule, that benefited from it, still hail him. Even today, there are protests by older conservatives calling for the decriminalization of the former president. The rest of us are hardly sympathetic, and a lot of this resentment is also being carried on to such people.

Here's a similar argument I might make: being poor is a choice. (Almost) anybody could move to a shitty part of town with low rent, walk an hour to work, cut out all entertainment from their lives, and just buy food and toilet paper, and they'd save tons of tons of money. Why don't they do that? Why are there poor people? There are myriads of reasons of why that logic is wrong. And I would bet most of them would apply to losing weight as well.

I voted for Trump, I think words like ""white nationalism"" and ""white supremacy"" and ""racist"" and ""nazi"" get trotted out way to much as a cheap rhetorical ploy. I've seen the tapes and I don't think that Donald Trump has ever admitted on camera to hating muslims or latinos. I saw this headline and assumed it was more liberal bullshit. But no, that's fucking white nationalism. That's unabashed white nationalism, racism, white supremacy. Laura Ingraham is a racist. I can't believe that aired on television, I'm horrified.

If we take their name+face away from news reports once the attacker is not a threat to the public anymore, then the fame/notoriety goes away.

If we are going to ban people from flight based on demographics why not use these two since they are better predictors of violence than religion? They are also much easier to check and verify.

You said that taxpayers should never have to pay for sports stadiums, so I guess all one has to do is show one example where it was beneficial. I'd like to draw your attention to the 2010 olympic games in my home city, Vancouver. By 2014 the Vancouver Olympic Comittee paid off their debts, and the infastructure built for the olympics is still kept in good shape. A good example is the Richmond oval, which is still used for a ton of events.

I really hadn't thought there was anyone my age who didn't know, because we were in the perfect range where we grew up with the game. I guess you're one of today's lucky 10,000!

As a fellow Libertarian, the GOP is still going to be the lesser of the two evils for me. I'm much more concerned about the economic and constitutional aspects of Libertarianism than the social issues aspect, partly due to the cramming down the throat way the left has started going about things. That being said the Republicans suck and I dread my dream of them and the Democrats being dismantled won't happen in my lifetime.

Every school I toured when I started looking at colleges had either someone manning the door or required two separate anonymous swipe cards to access a room. I’m not sure if Utah has something similar, but if not, that’s a major security oversight on their part.

The biggest problem with American politics is that our politicians are all bought. ""Government is the entertainment division of the military industrial complex."" What this means is that the ""liberals vs conservatives"" stuff is a farce. It's a show they put on to make us think our opinions matter when all that really matters is money.

Too late for that. The white rhinos are gone for good. On an unrelated note, Japanese whalers are back hunting whales. Imagine if the whales had gone instinct and THEN the Japanese government starts jailing the whalers. It's sort of ingrained in our heads that we won't do any action on these kinds of things until the damage is already done. By that sense, no one's going to do anything about Climate Change until we get a real-life Waterworld scenario.

You seem to have forgotten the benefits of alcohol. It doesn't only have downside, like any of the drugs that are consumed regularly around the world. What he describes sounds like he was able to get a little bit more comfortable due to the alcohol. That initial boost in comfortableness could very well be what's made it possible for him to have a good evening, sure he likely could have got the same effect through other means but that doesn't make it's a bad thing.

Bahahaha, typical response. I do not justify anyone making death threats on anyone. Why is it liberal cities have the highest crime rates in the US? Why are liberals calling for peoples heads in DC tonight? Why will the next mass shooting in our country, just as the last, be committed by someone with liberal ideals. Liberalism is a disease that manifests itself in those who think they are better than anyone, yet believe they are owed something from society.

I set my first alarm to 30 minutes before I need to wake up, and I take my Ritalin. I dont even turn on the lights, I just grab it, swallow it, back to sleep. When the alarm to wake up comes on, the ritalin is kicking in and it's much easier. Then I sit up and I loudly proclaim ""yeeeah baby!"",like Ronnie Coleman about to do a set, cause a guy once told me to do that when I woke up to just boost my energy and morale and it works.

It's just an observation on my part, though I think it can be attributed to sexual selection. Until very recently a wealthy, powerful, socially dominant provider type would have boosted the probability of a woman's genes surviving. Would be neat to see some data on this, there's always interesting stuff to be seen in studies of human sexual selection. In 'primitive' warring cultures like the Yanomami in the Amazon there's a huge disparity in reproductive success between men who've killed and those who haven't.

Turning that into a closed doors, one-on-one ritual of handing regular kompromat to the authorities was never going to end well, and Pius X mandating that confession should begin at the age of seven turned a mistake into a disaster.

More than anything else, Reddit in general has dropped my opinion of women to almost nothing. I used to think (as I had been taught) that women and men were ""just people"", but Reddit and especially subs like askwomen and trollxchromosomes make it apparent that most women spend most of their time thinking about ways to make men - especially men they don't know - suffer.

Nice! I bussed to go see Spider-Man 3 when it first came out, enjoyed it very much! If possible I would try to avoid sitting in the middle tho! It’s common theater etiquette to stay off to the sides as a single patron; allows for larger groups to fill in so they can all sit next to each other. Happy watching!

I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell because of the subreddit I am in, but I hardly feel like forcing someone into a new/different career is the answer. What if that pharmacist became a pharmacist before birth control was created? How is it their fault that the ""job requirements"" you are placing on them changed since they got their degree? This seems more like a Walgreens problem rather than an individual pharmacist problem. They should make sure to have multiple pharmacists. Regardless of the individual pharmacist's beliefs, no one should be forced to provide something against their morals

I'm baffled how you originally stated your view as ""Old reddit is in every way conceivable superior to new reddit from an end user"" and you've appeared immovable. Your defenses of your view have focused on your personal experiences, so you are only considering a how one or the other is superior to you or people in situations similar to you. There have been a plethora of explanations how the new reddit has improved the user interface experience for at least some portion of users, which I think you ought to give them at least some credit.

If you like EDM and want some isolation from the outside world the DT770 will be a better pick. they are a lot more fun sounding (meaning bass boosted) and are very comfy and durable. The HD558 are not nearly as sturdy and don't isolate...but they have a cleaner midrange and less bass/ treble. that means they sound more natural for movies, but lack the bass slam you want for EDM.

If you looked at the odds for this game you’d think it was 1st vs 18th, not 17th vs 18th. Carlton were $1.10 this morning and GC were out to $6. Pretty fucked up. I don’t know if this is telling of how bad of a position Gold Coast is in or how much Carlton has improved, either way, i found it so strange to see and thought it was worth mentioning.

Actually, I think this is changing somewhat. My generation (millennial) was the generation that really got hit hard by studio internet porn. Hardcore stuff that is unrealistic in every way and shows an unhealthy relationship with sex. But the children growing up now are growing up in an internet with vast amounts of amateur porn. Amateur porn is far more realistic and show healthier sex. I hope I'm right about this.

If that discipline is directly encourages better behavior, its necessary. like,forbidden to use a phone while its overused.or, If child doesn't follow rules repeatedly, discipline is necessary.thats what I said in previous post. but If that was spanking, like I said it encourages child to use violence against others. Well, Its hard to imagine what kinds of crime is tolerable, but if that was apparently intolerable(like hurt someone for no reason), they should go to court.

Not really. Since in Muslim flights they would kill mostly Muslims, it would help since these segregated flights help cool off the tensions between the religions and cultures. If a 100 Europeans die, Europeans would be angrier at Muslims than if a 100 Muslims die. Sometimes separations are the right thing.

Yeah. I got married and had two kids over the last 5-years. My mother in law is adamant that we must get our kids baptized. I tell her, when a week passes where the church is not defending themselves for horrible current or past abuse, I will schedule to get it done... Keeping my kids away from the church should be a big priority for any parents, given all the nasty shit that has been uncovered over the years.

Sort of? I mean, we’re aware of the stuff that you’re saying. It really depends how they’re presenting. Depression and anxiety exist on a spectrum, so even if people’s symptoms aren’t consistent with a clinical diagnosis, they can still often benefit from therapy, and their treatment would be adjusted accordingly.

That's not how the burden of proof works. You made the claim- ""the cops faced repercussions""- and now you want *me* to prove it false? No no no. *You* have to provide evidence that they *were* punished. Edit: furthermore, you still didn't address the fact that Trump hasn't spoken a word condemning this. He has time to call LeBron James ""low iq"" on Twitter, he has time to attend rallies and watch Fox and Friends, but he doesn't bother to shoot out a single tweet in solidarity of kids who were raped by law enforcement on his watch?

It seems to be working just fine in Finland. I'm not sure that it really would open the door to more conspiracy theories though. I mean I don't think anyone is saying don't report on the shootings. We're just saying don't turn the shooters into celebrities. And celebrities is a good word for a lot of these shooters. Many of them have become household names with the amount of coverage they've received. I don't agree with a government ban but I think the media should self-regulate here just as the Finnish press did a decade ago.

Your idea (while posing a real problem with ethics) won't work as: - it provokes the terrorists who will make the effort of taking down a plane against this method just to show that you can't hideux anywhere. - it will encourage a part of the people you ban to join the terrorists. There's a handful number of people who are in the hesitating and doubting phase about sharing ISIS's view. Banning Muslims and people with certain names will only show weakness from democracies, and only confirm ISIS's ideas about occident.

Iirc, affection deprivation is considered abuse, and cheating is a ground for fault divorce. So no problem here >What if a partner takes a job that requires 80-90hrs per week of work and you never see them? Then what, you are unhappy that they spend that time making money from which you benefit, so you would like to just go away but still benefit from that money, and force them to keep that workload despite it being also a part of the compromise going with the relationship?

Prostitution is usually prohibited because of reasons unrelated to prostitution itself, e.g the country's economy. The ""2 consenting adults"" isn't always the case. Instead, poor girls become prostitutes because they don't have any other real choice So, yes, if you live in a country in which there's the educational, economical and societal advancement necessary to guarantee that the majority of times prostitutes will be prostitutes by choice, sure, but that's not the reality in many places

There would be no way to keep the shooter's (or multiple shooters) name out of the press. And even if there were a way to arrest and/or prosecute them without it coming out, the details of the shooting are likely the thing that would generate a copycat shooting, not the shooter's name.

This may be purely anecdotal on my part and I admittedly don’t have stats to back this claim up, but I feel based on my experience that most young people lean Democratic, and the ones that are Republican are either very religious or have embraced the alt-right platform. There are very very few young Republicans who abide by the social freedom platforms. They’re almost all against gay marriage and immigration reform. They want to ban both.

Unpopular opinion: If Trump engaged in a trade war with China alone, I wouldn't blame him or the US for doing so. China has been, frankly, abusive in their economic relationships. If he did so without starting trade wars with, say, Canada (my own country) over nothing, or the EU, etc. I would not disapprove as much.

You know what Putin wouldn't love? If we finished our goddamned fast reactor and salt reactor programmes. We'd steal a giant portion of his lunch, hand it to our own energy industry, and bestow it's IP upon the world. Russia's worked hard on the BN series of reactors so they can be first-to-market with fast spectrum. It'd be _terrible_ if someone stole that from them.

I think the real core issue is ""sex without consequences"". It's not just about abortion though, as this article states it's also about contraception - how long did it take to get the morning after pill OTC? I remember that being a huge deal. I don't generally agree with abortion (and I lean conservative/republican) but I understand why it's necessary. I just don't see how you can parade around limited government but also want to use that same government to limit other people's rights whether it's abortion, marijuana, etc.

Because once a biological woman has undergone sex change or transitioned, they are then a male. I feel like that's what you're thinking, a woman who has transitioned completely into a male saying ""I am biologically female"" - which is then wrong. They're still of an XX chromosomal type, but everything else biologically is male, including secondary sexual characteristics and a phallus. In case you mean people in the middle of transitioning, then they should still be going to the bathroom of their original sex.

You'll find there's a wide variety of beliefs among libertarians, some closer to anarchists, but most are more pragmatic. In the US you'll likely find most libertarians to want limited Federal government, leaning towards the rights of states to make their own laws. Most still believe the Federal government should have key responsibilities like national defense, the justice system, State department, etc.

I get the principle angle, but is principle really worth closing down (potentially) hundreds and maybe thousands of churches across the nation that are working on a shoestring budget right now? Again, communities will suffer as a result of this. The only time I really volunteered at homeless shelters (sadly) is when I was a kid and went to church regularly with my parents. I think my story is not uncommon, either. I'm just challenging you to consider all the negative consequence you're going to drive as a result of personal principle.

Who is saying we should force laws that abolish gender? All I and most who I know say is we shouldnt force gender roles and expectations on kids based on gender. So, stop telling boys they cant play with dolls. If a boy wants to say with dolls, fine. If he wants to play with toy cars, fine. The point is it should be up to them and we shouldnt force them to do what we want. But few people I've seen in any context are actually calling for the abolition of gender entirely.

It sort of like a digital currency but the latter at the very least adheres to a certain axiom (less bitcoin < more bitcoin).

You cannot prove a negative. That someone died because of a lack of vaccination, because no vaccine has ever proven to be 100% effective. Also, it's very rare that someone dies because of whatever the vaccine is supposed to prevent. People die because of the effects of an illness which have a myriad of causes and effects. For example, AIDS doesn't kill people directly. It's the effects AIDS has that causes other failures of the human system.

^^^ exactly. doctors are right until they’re not. then they don’t take any responsibility for it. I’m not an antivaxer and don’t even have kids, but the truth is there are a lot of contradicting studies out there. No one is trying to kill their kid or kill other people’s kids.

Or... 10 years from now you hear that he died alone on streets, homeless, hungry, shunned by society, addicted to crack.

Breastfeeding prevents illness in infants too young for inoculation due to antibodies in the mother’s milk. By your same argument, parents of formula-fed babies who die of common disease should be prosecuted, since donor milk is available, unless parents can prove that the baby can’t have breast milk for medical reasons. Of course this is ridiculous! And I’m not arguing it. But it’s in the same vein as your argument because breastfeeding does protect young babies and children.

I had one a year ago. I don't regret it for many reasons, mainly because of the person the father turned out to be, but it was either be sad but keep going or be sad with a new baby (which made me feel like Id turn out to be more sad). If its what you need to do, or even just what you want to do, its your body and your rules. I know I made the right choice, but I still feel the sad. You come to accept it. Its okay.

This cemented it for me today. Listening to that bellowing Scottish Remainer woman last night promising they'd reform and fix the EU actually gave me hope. I know they'd try and do it too if they were 'allowed' but the EU has ironically been more honest about it than the Remainers and their empty promises. We are not getting anymore changes from the EU and they've now made that clear. So if you don't like that, then you know what to do tomorrow.

I agree with you except that you are leaving out the impact of divorce on a family. We want to be with our wives, but we also want to have the same sex we had with the girlfriend that became our wife. We would rather not have an open relationship, but still want the attention we used to receive.

There was a Facebook post making the rounds years ago where a nurse bragged about how she scheduled the shot for herself, got the paper that ""proved"" she'd made the appointment, and just never showed up to get the shot. She was so proud of herself that she didn't have to wear masks around patients in the pediatric cancer ward - because ""they need to see a smiling face"" This is one of the few cases where my rage screamed DOX THIS BITCH NOW

That's true, but 13% isn't *that* much. As well as that, their support is steadily declining now, since many of their voters were Eurosceptic Conservatives who essentially just used them as a protest vote. They're also severely unpopular with the people who don't vote for them - most people say they wouldn't even consider it. Last I checked, Nigel Farage had a favourability rating of something like -53 in the UK.

The inequality in this country, especially that of wealth and class disparity, isn't solvable by restricting a person's ability to make the free decision to be an unpaid intern. The solution you seek to the problem that ""poor people don't make enough money"" is to remove another potential revenue stream from them? If you really wanted to fix this problem you should be targeting the government and the corporations that got us in this mess not preventing a young adult from gaining vital experience.

I know some successful people who drink at least that much sugar and caffeine in energy drinks, so it's not that absurd.

Well that's a graceless generalization, BANNED! I'm current banned for telling a (upvoted) joke. They said it was against the rules. When I asked how it was against the rules, they said they have to enforce the rules neutrally. When I asked what that meant and what rules they were actually enforcing they said they didn't think my joke was funny to be honest. That is literally the opposite of neutral enforcement. When I questioned that they made fun of me for not being able to do anything about it.

I don't care what the nfl is doing but I do think these things are different. Companies like YouTube Twitter and Facebook are an outlet for people to talk while the NFL has nothing to do with politics. The overly common demonization of conservative YouTubers gives incentive for upcoming news outlets to be more left leaning regardless of what they actually want to be because it's more fiscally responsible. I believe all companies should have the right I do wish it was more transparent though.

I hate doing it cause it’s usually a cheap way that people try to win arguments by invalidating others just because they post in certain subs. However, in this case I think it is completely appropriate because it points out the hypocrisy of saying that Obama ignored the constitution while the individual posts in a cult-sub for a president who has no regard for the constitution. I also like how you ignored me saying that it doesn’t invalidate his opinions or him, it makes you defending your fellow T_D poster seem more noble doesn’t it?

Having a binary means there's literally two options. Your gender can't be non-binary if gender is binary. What people mean when they say get rid of the binary, is accept that there's more than two options, that you don't have to be only a man or a woman. So it seems like you already agree with the goal, and are just misunderstanding what get rid of the binary means.

So what do you make of that fact that many other countries have much lower aggregate wage gaps than the U.S.? Do they have ""biologically different women""? Or is it just possible that there are cultural reasons that some countries end up having more or less wage inequality in aggregate than the U.S.?

Have you read the book ""The giving tree""? You cant be too generous. A boss that pays salaries needs to be able to afford these salaries. A company needs to be profitable to afford salaries. And for that, every cog in that wheel needs to be important. Your boss cant do it alone, thats why he has help. And in order to get the best help, you need your employees to have a high moral and be loyal. You cant have loyal happy workers if you treat and pay em like shit. They will just leave.

The easiest by far argument against the existence of God, is the ""reverse No-True Scotsman"". Since the definition of what/who god is, is completely subjective and open, no matter what proof you show, it can be dismissed as ""no, I meant a different kind of god (insert a special quality here)"". Even if god himself were to show up personally and do an AMA, we could dismiss him/her/it as ""not the ACTUAL god, just some kind of absolute cosmic creator, but surely not THE creator"".

Any entity which has ""a shoestring budget"" isn't going to owe much in taxes. That's how a progressive tax system works. The ones that would owe a lot of tax money are the ones that could afford to pay it. There are plenty, and the difference is just like that between Wal-Mart and your favorite Mom & Pop store. Frankly, taxing huge churches would ever-so-slightly level their playing field with smaller churches. And given that the smaller ones are (proportionately) doing more charitable work, they would be even less likely to be harmed by this change.

I also learned that (almost) every time a girl does the “wow your hands are so big” thing and then you both put your hands up to compare size, theyre lowkey into you and it was just an excuse to make some physical contact with you.

No, it doesn't. Contraceptives should be available with no limitations to anyone capable of having sex. If pharmacies are only denying these services to people of a certain age (teenagers) then that would be discrimination based on age. There are laws barring minors from buying tobacco and alcohol, and for good reason. This is not the case for contraceptives. These are completely unrelated. Obviously age discrimination usually happens to older people, but to say it cannot happen to younger individuals is ignorant.

While I agree it's annoying to be encouraged to drink when you don't want to, it's also annoying to be a buzzkill. There are some contexts where being the only sober person is not going to be fun and you'll bring others down unless you're very good at disinhibiting yourself.

Democracy doesn’t work for foreign affairs, and it probably isn’t the best call for healthcare either. If everyone made their normal irrational decision, every American would spend about 2/3rd of their lifetime healthcare spending in the last months of life. That’s irrational, and it’s also when healthcare is most expensive and most difficult for treatment. So nobody wants to spend a dime more, but everyone wants to spend as much as possible right before they or their loved one dies. Democracy is the worst way to make something efficient, and in turn to allow better healthcare for more people.

5'10"", but anything under 6'2"" is considered short in America especially with all the hormones in food (I wouldn't know). I guess the best thing is no attention from women because they think you automatically have a small dick, are anti-social, have no money, and are least desirable sexually. A substantial % of women would rather date outside their race if the guy's taller. It's good because I realize what stupid whores American women are. I can't wait for my early retirement outside the country, where life is cheaper/higher quality due to not having stupid women contributing to regulation.

A little of both for me. Deep down inside I don't really think I want to though. My standards are too high and any girl who would be down for a one night stand with me would make me paranoid about the likelihood of her having some kind of STD. I'd much rather get to know someone before having sex with them.

Men will have to preen more and peacock more to attract women since strength isn't an advantage anymore. I think we will get overly romantic. More flowery gestures etc. Sports will be more egalitarian. Maybe Men's sports will have to get more violent and bloody to separate itself from mixed or women's sports.

Outside of harassing behavior, most of the time I hear that phrase coming from people who think that any reminder that the other person is not straight is tantamount to ""pushing it in their face."" Those are the people who think that they are already making a big sacrifice by not saying mean things to people who are not straight - a ""you stay hidden, I'll stay quiet"" type of bigotry.

I can only try to change your view by offering problems that may be larger - I just can’t downplay the importance of your point. 1. The method we use to vote (referred to as “first past the post” I believe) will always lead to a two party system. If we change the method used for voting, we would have more choices; it would no longer be us vs. them. 2. It is human nature to stay away from perspectives we disagree with. Viewing the other side as the enemy is just a small part of this problem.

The important operator here is the **State** of Russia. The average Russian person isn’t involved with these offenses; it is people intimately involved with the Russian governmental body that must be punished. Unfortunately, this is difficult to achieve. Things like sanctions disproportionately affect the average Russian citizen more than the oligarchs. What is really necessary is something more along the lines of overthrow and/or assassination of those in power.

Girls started becoming a LOT more aggressive. Touching my arms, rubbing my bald head, etc, even if I didn't know them and just happened to be walking through a grocery store. Usually, they played it off like ""oh no, I thought you were someone else"" or some shit. Also, I got treated a lot differently by other guys too. I hit the gym pretty hard, and my arms, chest, and shoulders grew significantly, and other guys were either asking me for gym tips, or they were much more respectful towards me.

I'd say this depends on how good you are at being bad. Fraud can push you forward financially, but you're likely to crash and burn due to the law. I feel like people are also less likely to purchase from a company that is legally immoral, but if you'd manage to succeed, you would make a large sum of money through fraudulent procedures.

And historically men were asked to risk life and limb in armies and women weren't. You can indeed say that men were required to do that because people had a low opinion of female battle skills. Just as you can say that women were not allowed to earn money because people had an expectation of men to provide for women and protect them.

I realized I was sort of ""waiting"" to do things until I had someone to do them with, but so many times, I would always do what the other person wanted to do.

Well it depends on what question. Most liberals want such uneven treatment stopped and half of the conservatives think we give to much aid and support to Israel. Most Americans are sick of their politicians being bought on both sides of the aisle. Still I will agree that most Americans side with Israel more than Palestine in the conflict, though I think most Americans think that the Palestinians are more of the aggressors than the Israelis.

If you want to ever see libertarian ideals implemented in society you need to vote republican in the present, or America will irreversibly turn into a socialist society that does not tolerate libertarianism. It’s really that simple. If Democrats continue appointing Supreme Court Justices you will never have a shot in hell of achieving any libertarian ideal. Say what you will about republicans, they at least appoint originalist justices that don’t use the constitution for toilet paper.

Not necessarily. If this map is showing that there are more crimes where more people live then the map may just be showing migration patterns. Doesn't mean an area became more or less safe (risk) and it doesn't really show anything about resource allocation (to get at this you'd have to examine where resources were deployed each year; allocation is more about effectiveness and efficiency than it is throwing raw sums at problems and hoping they work).

I got all of my “vaccines” via the natural way one would contract the flu virus like a sneeze or a cough aka the inhaler kind. I believe that this is a great way to administer vaccines to kids. I am pro vaccination advocate as a future health professional but I do believe this is a great way to do it. I mean you’re likely not gonna be injected with the flu, but you’ll get sneezed on. Maybe they should just put it through the air vents at some schools. Lol.

I'm pretty confident of it. This dimension has a lot of good and evil. There are places where kindness and goodness are the norms and not the exceptions. This earth is not sane but it has a lot of good people in it. Hang in there and take good care of yourself. Get your rest. Drink clean water and eat as health as you can. Take a break from the news for a few days if you have to. Be in nature if you can. I wish you the deepest peace.

I kind of just think alimony should go away. it's a product of a time before women were equal in the workforce. There is really no justification for it anymore. (Child support is an entirely different story) but just going ""woman gets alimony"" or ""they make less money"" Doesn't justify taking someone else's money. If there was wrong doing and reparations need to be paid that is for a civil court case to decide. Not divorce court.

In capitalism you make choices with your money. Poor choices allow stupid things to happen. Making a stupid choice doesn't mean the system is bad, the participants are. Outside of emergencies, you can shop around for a cheaper doctor. For education, you can go to a community college then transfer. You can get a degree in something that'll land you a job, instead of **insert demographics** studies, allowing you to pay off student loans. There are choices. Acting on impulse then decrying the result of your choice is the problem.

I did, but compared to the players that has already been listed in the 'top 20' category he certainly isn't #4. G2 has barely been relevant the last half of 2017. Yes, his numbers are impressive but that's with the minimum of maps they played in the group stage. If he barely scraped inside the top 10, then yes, I would agree. But ranked at #4? Come on.

People don’t talk about this much, but people in demanding careers tend to suffer in domestic areas. We do things like eat at restaurants and hire strangers to clean our homes. Others see these as luxuries, but sometimes they’re necessary to cope. Considering that, there is significant value in having somebody who takes care of you. Keep that in mind. If you like to cook and keep house, then she can just come home and chill. That’s a real luxury. That’s how you spoil her.

I've never had a one night stand, but I'm not sure I'd want to. I prefer sex with people I've got a vested interest in. The closest to a ONS I've had involved a weekend with this woman that I turned out to have no interest in, and that cemented my disinterest in further casual hook-ups.

If that's the only goal, of course I agree - but then, why am I hearing claims like changing the medical system, doctor's checklists, ways of living, giving up gender entirely and live in a gender less society - just to accommodate those 3-4% of people?

There's a problem. Public disorder, drug use, harmful soliciting went up and streetside price went down after NZ legalised it. The working girls in proper establishments get the protections and benefits, but you're accepting public sex, discarded condoms, faeces and general intimidating anti social behaviour by 6'5"" drag queens on random street corners. Don't legalise street whoring and you'll be better off than fully legalising it.

That's a perfectly valid criticism to make. But I would argue that going that route renders the entire argument meaningless. If you're going to question your ability to perceive reality, then you can't justify any knowledge or beliefs you have concerning reality. So while it is reasonable to suspect one's senses for the purpose of a philosophical debate, it isn't really meaningful outside of that context. In reality, you rely on your senses to survive. And you employ a form of the scientific method in order to do so.

I know 3 people who have full time jobs and are a part of FSAE. If they can do it, most people could. I’m not denying it’s hard, hell its hard even just being a full time student. And the previous experience schtik that some jobs have doesn’t necessarily mean experience regarding the actual job, they want to see you can work on a team and meet a deadline, what kind of accomplishments did you have, etc. Also, if someone doesn’t want to find themselves looking at internships that don’t pay, maybe they should study a STEM field.
