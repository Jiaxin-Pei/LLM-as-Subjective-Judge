0	0	a person	25	I don't think you can argue this very well, because someone who has less morals or ethics than another person is not excluded from acting morally or ethicallt, but someone who does have morals and ethics would not act immoral or unethical. For this reason the person who has less morals or ethics has a larger set of options when making money compared to the more moral/ethical, so they will always make equal or better than the moral person. I think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally.	1.0

There are two easy solutions: 1. Fully fund *everyone's* post-secondary education, so that governments can use their collective bargaining power to keep prices reasonable. 2. *Completely* eliminate loans and government bursaries for post-secondary education. Force schools to compete on cost again. This is a very capitalist solution.	2.0

By your same argument, parents of formula-fed babies who die of common disease should be prosecuted, since donor milk is available, unless parents can prove that the baby can’t have breast milk for medical reasons. Of course this is ridiculous! And I’m not arguing it. But it’s in the same vein as your argument because breastfeeding does protect young babies and children.	4.0

I also learned that (almost) every time a girl does the “wow your hands are so big” thing and then you both put your hands up to compare size, theyre lowkey into you and it was just an excuse to make some physical contact with you. Definitely wish she had told me that one earlier because I definitely missed a few hints with that one.	1.0

That’s irrational, and it’s also when healthcare is most expensive and most difficult for treatment. So nobody wants to spend a dime more, but everyone wants to spend as much as possible right before they or their loved one dies. Democracy is the worst way to make something efficient, and in turn to allow better healthcare for more people.	1.0

If you like to cook and keep house, then she can just come home and chill. That’s a real luxury. That’s how you spoil her.	1.0

2	0	a female	256	No, but the alternative is to allow the woman to not work and then if the marriage ends, she has nothing.

0	1	a White person	25	I don't think you can argue this very well, because someone who has less morals or ethics than another person is not excluded from acting morally or ethicallt, but someone who does have morals and ethics would not act immoral or unethical. For this reason the person who has less morals or ethics has a larger set of options when making money compared to the more moral/ethical, so they will always make equal or better than the moral person. I think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally.	1.0

0	1	a White person	313	In the case of education, its not so much capitalism, but a shitty system where it's considered okay to accrue significant amounts of debt without looking at the value proposition education offers, since loans are so easy to come by. There are two easy solutions: 1. Fully fund *everyone's* post-secondary education, so that governments can use their collective bargaining power to keep prices reasonable. 2. *Completely* eliminate loans and government bursaries for post-secondary education. Force schools to compete on cost again. This is a very capitalist solution.	1.0

Having sex when you're naturally infertile or barely fertile due to your hormonal cycle without protection doesn't lessen the natural chance of fertilization, and thus, is fine.	1.0

If we change the method used for voting, we would have more choices; it would no longer be us vs. them. 2. It is human nature to stay away from perspectives we disagree with.

Having sex when you're naturally infertile or barely fertile due to your hormonal cycle without protection doesn't lessen the natural chance of fertilization, and thus, is fine.	1.0

The point is it should be up to them and we shouldnt force them to do what we want. But few people I've seen in any context are actually calling for the abolition of gender entirely.	1.0

You can get a degree in something that'll land you a job, instead of **insert demographics** studies, allowing you to pay off student loans. There are choices.

I've never had a theist answer this question with anything but an appeal to emotion or popularity, or to ridicule moral relativism in place of it.

That’s irrational, and it’s also when healthcare is most expensive and most difficult for treatment.

If you're going to question your ability to perceive reality, then you can't justify any knowledge or beliefs you have concerning reality. So while it is reasonable to suspect one's senses for the purpose of a philosophical debate, it isn't really meaningful outside of that context. In reality, you rely on your senses to survive.

I think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally.	1.0

That’s irrational, and it’s also when healthcare is most expensive and most difficult for treatment. So nobody wants to spend a dime more, but everyone wants to spend as much as possible right before they or their loved one dies. Democracy is the worst way to make something efficient, and in turn to allow better healthcare for more people.	1.0

If you're going to question your ability to perceive reality, then you can't justify any knowledge or beliefs you have concerning reality. So while it is reasonable to suspect one's senses for the purpose of a philosophical debate, it isn't really meaningful outside of that context. In reality, you rely on your senses to survive.

1	2	an Asian male	25	I don't think you can argue this very well, because someone who has less morals or ethics than another person is not excluded from acting morally or ethicallt, but someone who does have morals and ethics would not act immoral or unethical. For this reason the person who has less morals or ethics has a larger set of options when making money compared to the more moral/ethical, so they will always make equal or better than the moral person. I think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally.	1.0

Fully fund *everyone's* post-secondary education, so that governments can use their collective bargaining power to keep prices reasonable. 2. *Completely* eliminate loans and government bursaries for post-secondary education.

I'm much more concerned about the economic and constitutional aspects of Libertarianism than the social issues aspect, partly due to the cramming down the throat way the left has started going about things. That being said the Republicans suck and I dread my dream of them and the Democrats being dismantled won't happen in my lifetime.	1.0

If everyone made their normal irrational decision, every American would spend about 2/3rd of their lifetime healthcare spending in the last months of life. That’s irrational, and it’s also when healthcare is most expensive and most difficult for treatment. So nobody wants to spend a dime more, but everyone wants to spend as much as possible right before they or their loved one dies. Democracy is the worst way to make something efficient, and in turn to allow better healthcare for more people.	1.0

2	2	an Asian female	4	I mean, I'm not particularly invested here. If you came out with some navy seal copypasta sounding story I likely wouldn't believe you. It's more that I find a lot of people take for granted their ability to handle panic situations well. I've been in a bunch of them. Sometimes I handled it really well, and a few times I broke and just lost my shit. Once I just shut down and walked away in a fugue.

The demand for rhino horns is literally just religious/cultural superstition. It revolves around a singular belief that's just total bullshit. Drugs work, and are addictive. They're not culturally relative. They're used globally, and they'll always be around. Therefore the blame for what goes on is different.	1.0

2	2	an Asian female	25	I don't think you can argue this very well, because someone who has less morals or ethics than another person is not excluded from acting morally or ethicallt, but someone who does have morals and ethics would not act immoral or unethical. For this reason the person who has less morals or ethics has a larger set of options when making money compared to the more moral/ethical, so they will always make equal or better than the moral person. I think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally.	1.0

Fully fund *everyone's* post-secondary education, so that governments can use their collective bargaining power to keep prices reasonable. 2. *Completely* eliminate loans and government bursaries for post-secondary education.

Well, Its hard to imagine what kinds of crime is tolerable, but if that was apparently intolerable(like hurt someone for no reason), they should go to court.	1.0

Still I will agree that most Americans side with Israel more than Palestine in the conflict, though I think most Americans think that the Palestinians are more of the aggressors than the Israelis.	1.0

1	3	a Black male	25	I don't think you can argue this very well, because someone who has less morals or ethics than another person is not excluded from acting morally or ethicallt, but someone who does have morals and ethics would not act immoral or unethical. For this reason the person who has less morals or ethics has a larger set of options when making money compared to the more moral/ethical, so they will always make equal or better than the moral person. I think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally.	1.0

1	3	a Black male	313	In the case of education, its not so much capitalism, but a shitty system where it's considered okay to accrue significant amounts of debt without looking at the value proposition education offers, since loans are so easy to come by. There are two easy solutions: 1. Fully fund *everyone's* post-secondary education, so that governments can use their collective bargaining power to keep prices reasonable. 2. *Completely* eliminate loans and government bursaries for post-secondary education. Force schools to compete on cost again. This is a very capitalist solution.	1.0

Also, the longer I go without having any romantic/sexual experience, how much less desirable does that make me? Did I miss my opportunity to have a first relationship?

Having sex when you're naturally infertile or barely fertile due to your hormonal cycle without protection doesn't lessen the natural chance of fertilization, and thus, is fine.	1.0

1	3	a Black male	582	It's just an observation on my part, though I think it can be attributed to sexual selection. Until very recently a wealthy, powerful, socially dominant provider type would have boosted the probability of a woman's genes surviving. Would be neat to see some data on this, there's always interesting stuff to be seen in studies of human sexual selection.

The overly common demonization of conservative YouTubers gives incentive for upcoming news outlets to be more left leaning regardless of what they actually want to be because it's more fiscally responsible. I believe all companies should have the right I do wish it was more transparent though.	1.0

Outside of emergencies, you can shop around for a cheaper doctor. For education, you can go to a community college then transfer. You can get a degree in something that'll land you a job, instead of **insert demographics** studies, allowing you to pay off student loans. There are choices. Acting on impulse then decrying the result of your choice is the problem.	1.0

1	3	a Black male	1456	People don’t talk about this much, but people in demanding careers tend to suffer in domestic areas. We do things like eat at restaurants and hire strangers to clean our homes.

If you like to cook and keep house, then she can just come home and chill. That’s a real luxury. That’s how you spoil her.	1.0

1	3	a Black male	1482	That's a perfectly valid criticism to make. But I would argue that going that route renders the entire argument meaningless. If you're going to question your ability to perceive reality, then you can't justify any knowledge or beliefs you have concerning reality. So while it is reasonable to suspect one's senses for the purpose of a philosophical debate, it isn't really meaningful outside of that context. In reality, you rely on your senses to survive.

2	3	a Black female	25	I don't think you can argue this very well, because someone who has less morals or ethics than another person is not excluded from acting morally or ethicallt, but someone who does have morals and ethics would not act immoral or unethical. For this reason the person who has less morals or ethics has a larger set of options when making money compared to the more moral/ethical, so they will always make equal or better than the moral person. I think a more difficult question is whether acting immorally makes you more money than acting morally.	1.0

Having sex when you're naturally infertile or barely fertile due to your hormonal cycle without protection doesn't lessen the natural chance of fertilization, and thus, is fine.	1.0

The point is it should be up to them and we shouldnt force them to do what we want. But few people I've seen in any context are actually calling for the abolition of gender entirely.	1.0

2	3	a Black female	1445	In capitalism you make choices with your money. Poor choices allow stupid things to happen. Making a stupid choice doesn't mean the system is bad, the participants are. Outside of emergencies, you can shop around for a cheaper doctor. For education, you can go to a community college then transfer. You can get a degree in something that'll land you a job, instead of **insert demographics** studies, allowing you to pay off student loans. There are choices. Acting on impulse then decrying the result of your choice is the problem.	1.0

2	3	a Black female	1456	People don’t talk about this much, but people in demanding careers tend to suffer in domestic areas. We do things like eat at restaurants and hire strangers to clean our homes. Others see these as luxuries, but sometimes they’re necessary to cope. Considering that, there is significant value in having somebody who takes care of you. Keep that in mind. If you like to cook and keep house, then she can just come home and chill.

2	3	a Black female	1482	That's a perfectly valid criticism to make. But I would argue that going that route renders the entire argument meaningless. If you're going to question your ability to perceive reality, then you can't justify any knowledge or beliefs you have concerning reality. So while it is reasonable to suspect one's senses for the purpose of a philosophical debate, it isn't really meaningful outside of that context. In reality, you rely on your senses to survive.
