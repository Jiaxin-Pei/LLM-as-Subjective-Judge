We have actually downsized the group since the departure of Robert Greer and Anna Briggs. 

I also identified replacement for the one Associate rotating out in the summer. 

In terms of Analysts, we have two rotating out in the summer, but we really prefer analysts with a year of experience and will take our chances identifying and hiring them.

Since summer is not likely to be a really busy time for us this year, I don’t think we need summer A/A’s.

I hope this email finds you well. It's great to hear from you. However, I must apologize for my previous message's language and tone. Looking back, I realize that it was impolite and unprofessional, and I regret any offense that I may have caused.

I am currently experiencing some physical and mental challenges that have affected my ability to invest adequately. I have been considering alternative options for securing my finances, such as burying my money in a secure location. Additionally, I have been contemplating purchasing a new car or a property, but my low utility bill of only $20.00 has given me pause.

I mentioned to Jan that I would provide ETS (and other BUs) with specific Adaytum project expense coding which has been used for previous training classes. She said it didn't matter to her if the business units coded their additional training classes to its own expense account, without charging the costs directly to the expense work order which Project Sunrise set up. Therefore, you do not need to transfer the costs which you have already coded to expense on ETS' books.

Thanks for the response. Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at

the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be. Jerry would

probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each

event and may already have something in mind. That's actually another

reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.

Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to

reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Hope things are going well. I got your email address from Andrea, who also told me you'd moved to Pittsburgh.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss the current state of Enron and its potential impact on our work. It appears that the company is facing some challenges, with the stock prices continuing to decline and a significant note due soon. As such, there may be some concerns about the availability of collateral.



With that in mind, I would like to suggest that we explore all options to ensure that our work remains unaffected, including the possibility of Joe returning to work if needed. If things become more challenging, we could also consider the option of moving back to Omaha and living in a trailer by AKSARBEN.



I understand that this may be a difficult time, and I want to assure you that I am committed to working together to find the best solution for our team.

I would like to add electronic index descriptions to the database. They are located on page three of the Gas Daily publication, and we can easily insert the location of the electronic index where we currently have the gas daily index survey language in the GD swaps in the database. 



I would like to have electronic GD swaps for the following points:

- El Paso Permian

- El Paso Non-Bondad

- Kern River/Opal Plant

- SoCal Gas

- Large packages. 



We will also need to add ""electronic"" to the product title to differentiate between the two GD swaps.



Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!

I believe William has the ability to find a rotation that will meet his needs.  However, his skill set is not what I'm looking for at this moment.  I will consider William for future rotations with West Gas.

However, I want to assure you that I will do my best to attend if possible. I will keep you updated on my availability and let you know as soon as I have a clearer idea of my schedule. If I am unable to make it, I will be sure to reach out and let you know.



Thank you again for the invitation, and I hope to see you soon.



Best regards,

Elizabeth Sager

Intercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent. I've been talking to Jim and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated. This issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Thank you for your time.

Following our conversation this morning, I would add 2 further points:
- John D agreed we could add something to 1b that explains what %age of bonus is paid in rest stock (i.e. 25% with a 25% discount) and it's vesting period.
- Additionally, my commercial guys would like to see 10 removed given a perceived overlap with 9. Can you let me know whether this is OK with you?
With above and the discussion we had earlier on a couple of other points, could we get a final version?

Good Afternoon! I hope you all are doing well. I wanted to check in with you on a few of my concerns. Has anyone confirmed that the Settlements are fine with invoicing no later that the 7th of each month? Also, I think we should look into making a longer term deal similar to the Interconnection Agmt. or if we should keep the same structure as MDEA.

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the recent performance of the stock market. As you may have noticed, there has been some volatility in the market, with the NASDAQ down 10% today and the Dow down almost 5% at one point. The TSE also experienced a dip, with a low point of 770 to 8880.



I believe that this downturn may be due to a number of factors, including margin positions being squeezed out of tech stocks. However, I also wanted to share my perspective on some solid stocks that I believe are still worth considering. In particular, I would recommend looking into CSCO, LU, MSFT, and ENE, as they all look very promising.



If you have any questions or would like to discuss this further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Quick question. Is your friend the one flying those signs around the building again? I noticed this yellow dust that is getting dumped on all of us and I was wondering if you'd be so kind to ask your friend if there's a way he could just fly the signs without dumping the yellow dust? Surely the dust cannot be healthy and i'd hate for it to upset peoples asthma and allergies.

The front desk said it was okay and then walked into the back room without writing your name or anything down.  I told him again what name and room number and he said ""no problem"".

Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a bankruptcy filing that is attached below.

I am pleased to inform you that I have completed the June 6 trading positions and will now proceed to set up the economics page, which I anticipate will not take much time.



I would appreciate your guidance regarding reversals from our currency book. Specifically, which direction should the reversals from the other books go?



Regarding the cash deals, I must mention that they are not all in the model for the June 1 - June 6 period, as the physical position is unbalanced. However, I plan to discuss this matter with Mike to find a suitable solution.



Overall, I am optimistic about the progress we have made so far and can see a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope this update will make things easier for you.

Since the majority of the division wants Klein High School, I'll live with it.

I agree that we should reduce the number of ""names"" from a global standpoint now while we can.

The routing portion of the workspace seems to work well, I agree, but the major issues lie with the confirmation side of it.

On another note, it seems I am duplicating work here. ie: I am using build route, transferring to excel (to get the font/colors, etc) then back to the workspace.

We'll see... I'll hit it again next week.

2020,"Hello Karen.

I received your question about severance pay in the event of employment termination. For your records, I'll repeat your question below:

""Will I still receive severance if the company files bankruptcy?""

To answer your question, it is unfortunately unlikely that severance payments would continue in the event of bankruptcy of the company. The general policy is that current or former employees of a bankrupt entity are considered as unsecured creditors, in line with other unsecured creditors. Due to this, employee claims will generally be represented through a court designated trustee. Please let me know if this answers your question, or if you need further information.

I had a meeting with David Thames (Global Finance) this morning. In short, he did not agree with your old structure and gave me a detailed explanation of his concerns. I don't necessarily agree with his argument, such as probability & volatility assumptions of the curve, which he didn't think we had at all in our valuation method. I will talk to Yvan tomorrow morning to find the exact structure/valuation method and let you know the result. It might happen because Davis didn't get the update on the latest/revised structure.

Thank you for your time. Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

I spoke with Frank Fields at Williams about the make-up gas from June 4. He wants to know what we needed it for and I told him I would find out and get back to him. He asked that you call Williams' scheduler Jeff tomorrow morning to fill him in and then they will buy the gas tomorrow so we should have this all sorted out by Wednesday.



I am still following up with Cinergy and Apache regarding this issue, so I will let you know how it resolved. 



Also, Chris talked with Lyn at TXU, and Lyn suggested that Sid Rich or Oasis into Lonestar would be good points. 



Thanks,

I mentioned to Jan that I would provide ETS (and other BUs) with specific Adaytum project expense coding which has been used for previous training classes. She said it didn't matter to her if the business units coded their additional training classes to its own expense account, without charging the costs directly to the expense work order which Project Sunrise set up. Therefore, you do not need to transfer the costs which you have already coded to expense on ETS' books.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to update you on the latest developments regarding our home office setup.



I'm pleased to share that we have updated our Remedy system to prioritize support for our home office workers. Additionally, we have made it a priority to assign any requests to Glenn or Robert whenever possible. Speaking of which, I'm happy to report that Glenn was able to successfully install a modem in Shirley's machine.



However, we are still experiencing some issues with the CITRIX Server and VPN access. Our solution center team believes that the problem may be on the Road Runner side, and Jean McFarland is currently working on a resolution. Despite this challenge, I am glad to report that everyone has been able to work from home with little to no issues.



Thank you for your understanding and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

I see you had already coded the expenses on ETS' books, so I just wanted to let you know that Jan had informed me, in their previous training classes, the business units coded their additional training classes to its own expense account but didn't charge the costs directly to the expense work order set up by Project Sunrise.

So, I was trying to let you know that you didn't need to transfer the costs that you already coded.

Thank You!

I would like to request that both of you work together to organize the upcoming Houston GISB meetings. If possible, it would be great to hold the meetings in Enron Center South. Not only would this be excellent PR, but it would also send a signal to our partners that everything is still the same.



Please let me know if you are able to get one of the meetings on the calendar. Thank you very much.

Following our conversation this morning, I would add 2 further points:

- John D agreed we could add something to 1b that explains what %age of bonus is paid in rest stock (i.e. 25% with a 25% discount) and it's vesting period.

- Additionally, my commercial guys would like to see 10 removed given a perceived overlap with 9. Can you let me know whether this is OK with you?

With above and the discussion we had earlier on a couple of other points, could we get a final version?

Thanks and have a good day.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding the rejection/assumption decisions and whether or not they need to be presented to the BTRC if they were already part of a signed Stipulation. I apologize if I may have caused any confusion or inconvenience, and I appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate through this process.



I have been scheduled on the BTRC agenda for tomorrow's meeting, but I understand that there may be some question as to whether BTRC approval is required. To clarify the matter, I have left a message with Chip Schneider to make sure a presentation is required. I am hopeful that we can confirm the necessary steps moving forward.



Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience, and I appreciate your assistance in ensuring that we are following the correct protocol.

I wanted to share some information with you regarding recent market trends. On Friday, Brent experienced a significant decline and I believe this may be a good time to consider selling. In case it's helpful, I suggest looking into relative storage levels and price levels for all BTUs in 1998. Relationships on the lower end of the spectrum can be a bit unusual, so I recommend keeping a couple of graphs handy: one chart showing all stocks as a percentage of full capacity, and another displaying BTU equivalents. It might also be useful to compare the two graphs and examine any differences.



I apologize that I don't have this information readily available to send over. Unfortunately, connecting to the Houston drive through Enron systems can be quite time-consuming. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.

On February 5, 2001 I sent to Legal, copies of Enron Financial. This confirms that they were altered by Counterparties (AEP, NRG Power, Cargill-Alliant, NYSEG,

Merchant Energy, Mirant, Constellation, Rochester). So, I'm just trying to check the status of the various issues, and to see if you needed any further information pertaining to the documents. If at all possible, can you please let us know who is handling the various Counterparties so we can go directly to the appropriate person with any inquiries in the future.

Thank you very much for your help.

I agree that we should reduce the number of ""names"" from a global standpoint now while we can.

I met with Davis Thames from the Global Finance group this morning.

He disagreed with the current structure. He walked me through

his concerns in detail. I disagree with his argument for some critical points, such as probability & volatility assumptions of the

curve. He did not think we had that at all in our valuation method. I will talk to Yvan tomorrow morning to find out the exact structure/valuation method and let you know the result. It might happen because Davis still needs to get the

update on the latest/revised structure. Thank you.

I have no need to increase the size of the group (in fact, with the departure of Robert Greer and Anna Briggs, we've actually downsized a bit).
I have one Associate rotating out in the summer but have already identified his replacement.  In terms of Analysts, we have two rotating out in the summer, but we really prefer analysts with a year of experience and will take our chances identifying and hiring them.
No need for summer A/A's.  Not likely to be a really busy time for us this year.

Let me know if TW can sell all of the Mavrix capacity within 60 days. If not, is he willing to take the financial risk, absolving Mavrix of responsibility for the difference?

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss a particular aspect of the deal that has been causing some concern. Specifically, I would like to request that Amerex's ability to execute over the phone be removed from the agreement.



I understand that this may be a sensitive matter, but I believe that this adjustment is necessary in order to ensure the success and fairness of the deal for all parties involved. I would like to work with you and the rest of the team to find a solution that meets everyone's needs.



Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. I look forward to your response and to finding a resolution that works for all of us.

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to

Thank you getting back to me. I do have a quick question hopefully you will be able to help me with. Is there any chance you could let me know when I will be able to access the curve validation file in the O:// drive; or if there is anything I need to do to secure those rights. Right now, Chance Rabon and I are working on tracking down who has the broker quotes. Chance has been doing the research and I have been contacting some of the trader from the West Desk.

Most of the division wants to hold the event at Klein High School, so that is what I think we should do.

It is not as conveniently located to the pool as Klein Oak's gym is but at least it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day. What do you think?

Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a bankruptcy filing that is attached below. Besides the normal complaints, they are claiming that we have not nominated since the petition date, or paid for firm storage service (Is our storage gas out of Bear Creek and did ENA pay for the storage service that was used?). The last four pages of the filing has a listing of the contracts that Tennessee has indicated are still active. I will contact EES about their contracts.

If you could think back and summarize the facts, I would really appreciate it.

I will talk to Mike about  the cash deals which are not all in the model (June 1 - June 6) because the physical 

position doesn't balance. 

I hope this would be finished soon and I think it would makes things easier on you. 

Thank you for all your hard work!

I have no need to increase the size of the group (in fact, with the departure of Robert Greer and Anna Briggs, we've actually downsized a bit).

I have one Associate rotating out in the summer but have already identified his replacement. In terms of Analysts, we have two rotating out in the summer, but we really prefer analysts with a year of experience and will take our chances identifying and hiring them.

No need for summer A/A's. Not likely to be a really busy time for us this year.

Thanks for all of your work documenting issues that can be improved with the project. Based on your comments, I have the following notes:

2) We should fix issues with the confirmation side of the routing portion of the workspace

3) We should reduce instances of duplicated work (e.g., using buildroute then transferring to Excel, and then transferring back to the workspace).

I wanted to inform you that all basis in Canada are quoted in terms of USD. The normal convention is to quote a fixed price in CAD. I'll ask Ian Cooke to forward you a historical basis for AECO in USD format. If you'd like a currency curve to work your numbers back into CAD we are also able to provide that. I'm not sure what that may tell you however. Please get back to me if there is anything else you require.

With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association, the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU. This will enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle. Should the vehicle now be found, the property rights to the vehicle will reside with PZU.

This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out. Unfortunately, I do

not allocate PGEV. Also, Sherlyn has actualized PGEV and she has the

had missed something in our conversation.

I wanted to let you know that we have not pursued this aspect from South America because we are unsure if it will bring any competitive sourcing in the future. This venture would take a few years to develop if we get it launched. Other companies don't seem to want to remain dependent on oil exclusively from South America. We will continue to keep our eyes on the situation and plan what to do moving forward.

I had a meeting with Davis Thames from Global Finance group this morning. 
Basically, he did not agree with your (old) structure. He walked me through 
on his concerns in detail. For some critical points, I don't necessarily 
agree with his argument such as probability & volatility assumptions of the 
curve. He thought we don't have that at all in our valuation method. I will 
talk to Yvan tomorrow morning to find out exact structure/valuation method 
and let you know the result. It might happen because Davis didn't get the
